    <string name="bio">Salem aleykoum, welcome to the salat tracker application.
\n\nBismillah El Rahman El rahim.
\nMaybe, you have experienced once to forget how many raqqat you have prayed.
\n\nThis application aimed to help or assist you to pray the right way our prophet Mohammed (peace and benediction upon him) taught us.
\n\nAt first, you will need to record a set of valid "pray references" for each daily salat.
\nThen, you will be able to track your salates and compare them to your references.
\nThe App will compare the salat time for each salat and the raqaat number.
\nWhen the App will detect an issue, it will propose a correction based on the Malik juridic school.
\n\nWe hope this App will help you to get your salat agreed by Allah the merciful.
\nYou can start by recording your salates references by clicking the "Reference" button below or go to the tracking by clicking the "Track" button.
\nWe pray Allah to agree our work upon his Name\n\n</string>
